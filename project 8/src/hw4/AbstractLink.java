/**
 * All crossable train links extend this class.
 * AbstractLink class serves as a foundation for all links.
 * This class defines a base for objects that link different points together, acting as pathways for trains to cross between locations.
 * It implements core functionality related to train crossings, ensuring simulations can track when a train enters or exits a linked area.
 * Provides a method get points that gets all the points in the points array.
 * Most importantly this has shift points, which moves the position vector the the next point available. After implementing shift points in every class individually,
 * it became obvious that they were all pretty similar. After some tweaking one shift points method could be used for all classes, making it able to be implemented here and never overridden
 * Establishes getNumPaths, which returns the basic answer of 3 for paths 1, 2 and 3.
