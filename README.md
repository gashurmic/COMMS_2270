# COMMS_2270

Course Overview
This course focuses on software development using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as modularity, abstraction, and code reuse. Students apply these concepts through hands-on projects involving:

Instance variables, methods, and encapsulation

Control structures: conditionals and iteration

Algorithms on strings, arrays, and lists

Recursion, searching, and sorting

Text parsing and file input/output

Interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes

Exception handling

Unit testing and debugging tools

Project Goals
Each project is designed to reinforce core OOP concepts and develop proficiency in:

Writing modular and maintainable code

Applying abstraction through class hierarchies and interfaces

Developing algorithms and using recursion effectively

Managing input/output and handling errors robustly

Testing and debugging with discipline and precision

Tools Used
Java (primary programming language)

JUnit (unit testing)

IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
